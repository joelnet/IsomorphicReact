# Isomorphic React for ASP.NET

This project uses the [Jint JavaScript Interpreter](https://github.com/sebastienros/jint) to create a single
Isomorphic codebase that runs on the client as well as the server.

# Why?

* React Controlls can be rendered on the server to improve SEO.
* React can be used to render server side templates.
* Common code base for server and client.

This project is only a proof of concept.
